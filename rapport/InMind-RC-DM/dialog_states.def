# This file defines the dialog states for the DM. This file is optional; if 
# the dialog states are not defined, the DM will use the name of the 
# focused agent as the name of the state. If this file is linked in the
# DM configuration (by dialog_states_file=...), then the state name will
# be determined by matching the name of the focused agent to the list 
# below; when a match is not found, the state is set to _unknown_

# The entries below are in the form: AgentName=StateName
# The entries are case-sensitive.
